This will only work if you have a valid self-signed certificate.  In the main directory for the application copy and paste this code in the command line `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes`.  There will be several prompts after this command is entered feel free to hit `return` until you get back to the command line.  After that run `http-server --ssl`. Now prefix the I.P. your serving files on with `https://`.  You should be able to run the app now!",
